# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Refactoring the large script.js file (4200 lines) into modular ES6 modules
- Improving code maintainability and organization
- Preparing for implementation of the refactoring plan

## Recent Changes
- Created a comprehensive set of refactoring documentation:
  - Revised refactoring plan with detailed phases
  - Module interface definitions for all modules
  - Module dependency diagram to visualize relationships
  - State management pattern using pub/sub
  - Detailed implementation checklist with verification steps
  - Testing strategy for the modular architecture
  - Project summary document

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of Phase 1: Setup & Proof of Concept
  - Create the js/ directory structure and module files
  - Update index.html to load main.js as a module
  - Implement config.js and utils.js
  - Create a minimal main.js
- Develop initial unit tests for core modules

## Key Decisions
- Using ES6 module system for code organization
- Standardizing on ApexCharts for all chart rendering
- Supporting modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Serving ES6 modules directly without bundling
- Implementing a custom pub/sub state management pattern
- Creating a single entry point (main.js)

## Technical Considerations
- Potential circular dependencies between modules
- State management through a centralized pub/sub system
- Test-driven development approach with Jest
- Modular architecture with clear interfaces
- Browser compatibility for ES6 modules
- Maintaining 95% test coverage

## Timeline Expectations
- Phase 1 (Setup & Proof of Concept): 1-2 days
- Phase 2 (Core Framework): 2-3 days
- Phase 3 (Data Handling): 3-4 days
- Phase 4 (UI & Interaction): 2-3 days
- Phase 5 (Chart Implementation): 2-3 days
- Phase 6 (Integration & Testing): 3-4 days
- Total estimated time: 13-19 days
