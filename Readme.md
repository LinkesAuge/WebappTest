# TB Chest Analyzer - Documentation (Client-Side Static Data Version)

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**

The TB Chest Analyzer is a single-page web application designed for players and members of the "The Chiller" clan in the game "Total Battle". Its primary goal is to load, process, analyze, and visualize player chest data exported from the game in CSV format. This tool allows users to gain insights into individual and comparative performance based on chest collection metrics.

**Version Type:**

This specific version operates **entirely client-side**. It fetches its primary dataset (`data.csv`) and scoring rules (`rules.csv`) from static files hosted alongside the main `index.html` file. It uses the user's web browser to perform all calculations and rendering. Data persistence across browser sessions relies on the static nature of the hosted CSV files (updated by the website owner) and `localStorage` for user preferences like language selection.

**Target Audience:**

*   Players of "Total Battle", particularly members of "The Chiller" clan.
*   Clan leadership or analysts looking to track member activity and scoring.

## 2. Core Features

*   **Static Data Loading:** Automatically fetches and parses predefined `data.csv` and `rules.csv` files on page load.
*   **Multilingual Interface:**
    *   Defaults to German (`de`).
    *   Provides a simple switcher in the header to toggle between German (`DE`) and English (`EN`).
    *   User's language preference is stored in `localStorage`.
*   **Structured Navigation:** A persistent top navigation bar allows easy access to different views:

    *   **Top 5 by Chest Count:** A small summary table listing the players with the highest `CHEST_COUNT`. Rows are clickable to navigate to the player's detail view.
    *   **Chart Modal:** An "expand" icon on each dashboard chart card allows viewing a larger version of the chart in a modal window.
*   **Full Data Table View (`Daten`):**
    *   Displays a comprehensive table containing *all* columns (core stats + all chest sources) from `data.csv` for *all* players.
    *   Supports sorting by clicking any column header (ascending/descending toggle).
    *   Horizontally scrollable to accommodate numerous columns.
*   **Charts View (`Diagramme`):**
    *   Displays larger versions of the main dashboard charts (Top Sources, Score Distribution, Score vs Chests, Frequent Sources).
    *   (Future Enhancement Placeholder: Could include options for "Clan Aggregate" data views or user-defined charts).
*   **Analytics View (`Analytik`):**
    *   **Category Analysis:** Allows selecting a specific chest source category from a dropdown. Displays a table ranking players by score within that category and a bar chart visualizing the score distribution for that category.
    *   **Placeholders:** Includes designated areas for future "Player Analysis" (e.g., comparisons) and "Clan Analysis" (e.g., aggregate trends) features.
*   **Score System View (`Punktesystem`):**
    *   Fetches data from `rules.csv`.
    *   Displays a sortable table showing the scoring rules (Typ/Type, Level, Punkte/Points). Supports sorting by each column.

# ChefScore Dashboard

A web-based dashboard for visualizing chef performance data across multiple weeks, with trend analysis and historical comparisons.

## Overview

ChefScore Dashboard provides comprehensive analysis of chef performance data, including:
- Overall statistics and rankings
- Detailed performance breakdowns
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Multi-week historical data tracking
- Trend analysis across time periods

## Data Structure

### Weekly Data Files

The application uses CSV files for weekly data with the following naming convention:
```
data/data_week_{XX}.csv
```

Where `{XX}` is the week number (e.g., `data_week_12.csv`).

Each CSV file should contain player performance data with columns like:
- PLAYER: The player's name
- TOTAL_SCORE: The player's total score
- CHEST_COUNT: Number of chests collected
- Additional performance metrics

### Week Configuration

Available weeks are configured in `data/weeks.json` with this structure:
```json
[
  {
    "week": "12",
    "file": "data_week_12.csv"
  },
  {
    "week": "13",
    "file": "data_week_13.csv"
  }
]
```

Each entry requires:
- `week`: The week number (string)
- `file`: The CSV filename for this week

Date ranges are calculated automatically based on the week number.

### Fallback Mechanisms

The application includes robust fallback mechanisms:
1. If `weeks.json` cannot be loaded, hardcoded fallback data is used
2. If individual week data files are missing, appropriate error messages are shown
3. Multiple checks ensure proper initialization of data structures

## Week Selection System

The week selection system follows this workflow:
1. `loadAvailableWeeks()` loads the week configuration from `weeks.json`
2. `initializeWeeklyData()` determines the latest week and sets it as default
3. `populateWeekSelector()` builds the week selector dropdown
4. `switchWeek()` handles changing the active week
5. Week data is loaded from the corresponding CSV file
6. The UI is updated to reflect the selected week's data

## Adding New Weeks

To add a new week:
1. Create a CSV file named `data_week_{XX}.csv` where `{XX}` is the week number
2. Place it in the `data/` directory
3. Add a new entry to `data/weeks.json` with the week number and filename
4. The application will automatically detect and include the new week

## Troubleshooting

If week data isn't loading properly:
1. Verify `data/weeks.json` has the correct format
2. Ensure CSV files exist in the specified locations
3. Check CSV files have the expected column headers
4. Review browser console for specific error messages

## Technical Implementation

The week system is implemented across several modules:
- `dataLoading.js`: Handles loading week data from files
- `history.js`: Manages historical data and week switching
- `utils.js`: Provides date calculation utilities
- `main.js`: Orchestrates the initialization process

Date ranges for weeks are calculated automatically using the ISO week standard.
