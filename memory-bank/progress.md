## Current Status

The application is currently **functional and usable**, with all primary features working. The most recent fix addressed an issue with the player detail view radar chart, which now correctly displays when a player is selected from the dashboard.

The core experience is complete and reliable, providing users with:
- Clear overview of player rankings
- Interactive data exploration through charts
- Detailed analysis for individual players
- Category-specific performance insights
- Multi-language support

The application performs well with typical datasets (≈100 players), though larger datasets might experience performance degradation without pagination or virtual scrolling.

## Known Issues

1. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - Tables can become slow with thousands of entries
   - Chart rendering may lag with very large datasets
   - Initial data processing is done on the main thread, which can cause UI freezing

2. **Mobile Experience Limitations**
   - Some tables require horizontal scrolling on small screens
   - Chart interactions can be challenging on touch devices
   - Dense information views need better adaptation for small screens

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Some advanced features may have inconsistent behavior in older browsers
   - Safari has occasional rendering differences with charts
   - Not fully tested across all browser versions

4. **Accessibility Gaps**
   - Keyboard navigation needs improvement
   - Screen reader support is limited
   - Color contrast could be enhanced in some areas

5. **Error Handling**
   - Some edge cases may not have specific error messages
   - Network errors during CSV loading need better recovery options
   - Error state UI could be more informative
