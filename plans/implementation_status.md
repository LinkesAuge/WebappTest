# Multi-Week Data & History Feature Implementation Status

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The multi-week data feature and History view have been successfully implemented according to the plan outlined in `multi_week_history_feature.md`. This document summarizes the implementation status and highlights key achievements and future enhancements.

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Data Structure and Organization
- ✅ Created data folder structure
- ✅ Implemented sample weekly data files (`data_week_13.csv`, `data_week_14.csv`, `data_week_15.csv`)
- ✅ Created `weeks.json` index file with metadata
- ✅ Added auto-updating script for weeks.json

### 2. Week Detection and Data Loading
- ✅ Implemented `detectAvailableWeeks()` function
- ✅ Created `loadWeekData()` function for specific week loading
- ✅ Added fallback mechanism for detecting weeks
- ✅ Modified core data loading to support week-specific files
- ✅ Added caching for recent week data

### 3. Week Selector UI
- ✅ Added HTML for week selector component
- ✅ Implemented week selection dropdown with available weeks
- ✅ Added navigation buttons (previous/next week)
- ✅ Implemented visual indicator for latest week
- ✅ Added proper event handling for week switching

### 4. History View
- ✅ Added "History" navigation item
- ✅ Created HTML structure for the history view
- ✅ Implemented `loadHistoricalData()` function
- ✅ Created `calculateHistoricalStats()` for data aggregation
- ✅ Implemented weekly totals table with key metrics

### 5. Historical Charts
- ✅ Implemented score trend chart
- ✅ Implemented chests trend chart
- ✅ Created top players performance chart
- ✅ Added category trend chart
- ✅ Implemented proper interactivity and legends

### 6. Testing
- ✅ Created unit tests for week detection and data loading
- ✅ Implemented tests for historical data processing
- ✅ Added tests for UI components
- ✅ Created simple HTTP server for local testing
- ✅ Added manual test page for functionality verification

## Key Technical Implementations

1. **Week Detection System**: 
   - Primary method: Parse `weeks.json` file for metadata
   - Fallback: Probe for known week patterns
   - Determines most recent week automatically

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Caches loaded week data in memory
   - Background loading of historical data
   - Optimized for quick week switching

3. **Data Aggregation for History View**:
   - Player tracking across weeks
   - Weekly totals calculation
   - Category-specific trend analysis
   - Dynamic aggregation based on available weeks

4. **Responsive UI**:
   - Week selector adapts to screen size
   - Charts resize appropriately
   - Mobile-friendly navigation

## Enhancement Opportunities

While the core implementation is complete, several opportunities for enhancement exist:

1. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement lazy loading for history charts
   - Add data compression for large datasets
   - Consider Web Workers for background data processing

2. **Advanced Analysis**:
   - Add player improvement ranking
   - Implement week-over-week change highlighting
   - Add predictive trend analysis

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add tooltips explaining history features
   - Create onboarding for first-time users
   - Further optimize mobile experience

4. **Testing Expansion**:
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Implement end-to-end tests for History view
   - Test with larger datasets (10+ weeks)

## User Documentation Updates

User documentation has been updated to include information about:
- How to add weekly data files
- Using the week selector
- Navigating the History view
- Understanding historical charts and tables

## Technical Documentation Updates

Technical documentation has been updated to include:
- The data structure for weekly files
- Format requirements for `weeks.json`
- Caching and data loading architecture
- Implementation details for historical data processing

## Auto-Updating weeks.json

To simplify the process of adding new weekly data files, a script has been created to automatically update the weeks.json file whenever new data files are added:

### How It Works

1. The script (`scripts/update_weeks_json.js`) scans the `data` directory for files matching the pattern `data_week_XX.csv`
2. For each file found, it extracts the week number from the filename
3. It then compares the found files with the existing entries in weeks.json
4. New entries are added to weeks.json with:
   - Week number
   - Calculated date range (start_date and end_date)
   - Reference to the data file
5. The most recent file (based on modification time) is marked as `is_current: true`

### Running the Script

To update weeks.json after adding new data files:

1. **Windows**: Double-click on `scripts/update_weeks.bat`
2. **Command Line**: Run `node scripts/update_weeks_json.js`

### When to Run the Script

Run the script whenever:
- You add new weekly data files to the `data` directory
- You want to rebuild the weeks.json file from scratch
- You need to update the date ranges for existing weeks

The script ensures that weeks.json always reflects the actual data files present in the system, making it easy to add new weekly data without manual JSON editing.
