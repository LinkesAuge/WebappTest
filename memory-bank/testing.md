# Testing (Aspirational Document)

**Note: This document outlines a testing approach that is planned for future implementation. The current version of the Chest Analyzer does not have a formal testing infrastructure in place.**

## Planned Test Structure

```
/tests                      # Future test directory
├── unit/                   # For testing individual functions
├── integration/            # For testing component interactions
├── e2e/                    # For testing user flows
└── fixtures/               # For test data and helpers
```

## Current Testing Approach

The Chest Analyzer currently uses the following informal testing methods:

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is currently the primary method of validation:

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Manual verification of all features
   - Testing all navigation paths
   - Validating data display accuracy
   - Confirming interactive elements respond correctly

2. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Chrome (latest)
   - Firefox (latest)
   - Safari (latest)
   - Edge (latest)

3. **Responsive Testing**
   - Desktop (1920x1080, 1366x768)
   - Tablet (768x1024)
   - Mobile (375x667, 414x896)

4. **Development-Time Testing**
   - Console logging for debugging
   - Browser DevTools for performance monitoring
   - Manual data inspection

## Future Testing Goals

### Planned Automated Testing

In future development, we plan to implement:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Tests for data processing functions
   - Tests for chart configuration
   - Tests for utility functions
   - Tests for state management

2. **Integration Tests**
   - View transitions
   - Language switching
   - Data flow between components

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Complete user flows
   - Dashboard interactions
   - Chart interactions
   - Player detail functionality

## Manual Test Procedure

### Current Test Workflow

1. **Setup**
   - Load the application in target browser
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Clear localStorage if needed (`localStorage.clear()` in console)

2. **Core Functionality Testing**
   - Verify data loads correctly
   - Check all views can be accessed
   - Confirm tables are sortable
   - Validate chart displays
   - Test player detail view
   - Verify summary statistics

3. **Language Testing**
   - Switch language to German
   - Verify all UI text changes appropriately
   - Check charts update with translated labels
   - Confirm tables show translated headers
   - Switch back to English and verify

4. **Responsive Testing**
   - Resize browser window to various dimensions
   - Use browser DevTools device emulation
   - Verify layout adapts appropriately
   - Confirm all functions remain accessible

## Error Detection

Currently, errors are detected through:

1. **Console Logging**
   - Extensive logging in key functions
   - Error messages for failed operations
   - Status updates for async operations

2. **Visual Inspection**
   - Checking for rendering issues
   - Verifying data presentation accuracy
   - Ensuring responsive behavior

3. **User Feedback**
   - Status messages for users
   - Clear error states
   - Loading indicators

## Future Testing Tools & Frameworks

For future implementation, the following tools are being considered:

- **Jest** - JavaScript testing framework
- **Testing Library** - For DOM testing
- **Cypress** - For end-to-end testing
- **Mock Service Worker** - For mocking fetch requests

## Immediate Testing Priorities

Should testing implementation begin, these areas would be prioritized:

1. **Data Processing Tests**
   - CSV parsing and transformation
   - Data sorting and filtering
   - Calculation of statistics

2. **Chart Generation Tests**
   - Correct data preparation for charts
   - Proper configuration of chart options
   - Handling of edge cases (empty data, etc.)

3. **UI Interaction Tests**
   - View switching functionality
   - Table sorting and filtering
   - Language switching
   - Chart interactions
