# Project Progress Report

## Overall Status

The project is in a transition phase with a focus on implementing a proper folder structure, creating testing infrastructure from scratch, and enhancing features. Recently, we've made significant progress in fixing critical initialization and data loading issues, as well as improving the Analytics page organization and chart functionality. We are now working on implementing a week selection feature to allow users to view data from different weeks.
