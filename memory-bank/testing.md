# Testing

## Current Testing Status

- ❌ No tests currently available - all previous tests have been deleted
- 🔄 Planning to implement a comprehensive testing framework from scratch
- 📝 Will follow test-driven development approach for future features

## Planned Test Directory Structure

```
/tests                      # Test directory (to be created)
├── unit/                   # For testing individual functions
├── integration/            # For testing component interactions
├── e2e/                    # For testing user flows
└── fixtures/               # For test data and helpers
```

## Current Testing Approach

With no automated tests in place, the project currently relies on manual testing:

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Visual verification of layout and design
   - Testing on different browsers and devices
   - Validation of user flows and interactions
   - Performance testing

## Manual Test Procedure

### Current Test Workflow

1. **Setup**
   - Load the application in target browser
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Clear localStorage if needed (`localStorage.clear()` in console)

2. **Core Functionality Testing**
   - Verify data loads correctly
   - Check all views can be accessed
   - Confirm tables are sortable
   - Validate chart displays
   - Test player detail view
   - Verify summary statistics

3. **Language Testing**
   - Switch language to German
   - Verify all UI text changes appropriately
   - Check charts update with translated labels
   - Confirm tables show translated headers
   - Switch back to English and verify

4. **Responsive Testing**
   - Resize browser window to various dimensions
   - Use browser DevTools device emulation
   - Verify layout adapts appropriately
   - Confirm all functions remain accessible

## Error Detection

Currently, errors are detected through:

1. **Console Logging**
   - Extensive logging in key functions
   - Error messages for failed operations
   - Status updates for async operations

2. **Visual Inspection**
   - Checking for rendering issues
   - Verifying data presentation accuracy
   - Ensuring responsive behavior

3. **User Feedback**
   - Status messages for users
   - Clear error states
   - Loading indicators

## Planned Testing Tools & Frameworks

For future implementation, we plan to use:

- **pytest** - Primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov** - For test coverage reports
- **pytest plugins** - For extending testing capabilities
- **Browser automation** - For end-to-end testing

## Testing Goals

1. **Create Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up testing environment
   - Create initial test structure
   - Implement first basic tests

2. **Develop Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Cover core functionality with unit tests
   - Implement integration tests for component interactions
   - Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Achieve >95% test coverage

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**
   - Set up automated test runs
   - Add test reporting
   - Implement quality gates
