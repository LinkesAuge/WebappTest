## Current Status

The ChefScore Analytics Dashboard is functional with **all core features implemented** and is ready for production use. The recent addition of multi-week data support and historical trend analysis significantly enhances the analytical capabilities of the application.

We have identified code maintainability issues with the large script.js file and have created a plan to refactor it into smaller ES6 modules.

### Key Achievements:

1. **Completed multi-week data feature implementation**:
   - Created test data files and index structure (`weeks.json`)
   - Implemented week detection and data loading
   - Built UI for week selection and navigation
   - Added History view with trend visualization
   - Implemented player tracking across weeks

2. **Created automation tools**:
   - Added script for automatic updating of `weeks.json`
   - Created batch file for easy execution of update tasks
   - Improved development workflow

3. **Fixed critical issues**:
   - Fixed JavaScript errors preventing application initialization:
     - Added missing `loadLanguagePreference` implementation or replaced with `getLanguagePreference` calls
     - Added `initializeTranslations` function to set up UI with current language
     - Created i18n compatibility layer to translate `i18n.t()` calls to our own `getText()` implementation
     - Added proper error display functions: `displayError` and `displayWarningMessage`
     - Fixed reference to `backToDashboardFromDetailedTable` element with correct ID
     - Added missing `historySection` element reference and all related history view DOM elements
     - Implemented robust weekly data system with proper `detectAvailableWeeks` function that doesn't rely on `determineLatestWeek`
     - Fixed `loadWeekData` function to use existing `loadStaticCsvData` instead of missing `fetchCSVData`
     - Added proper week selector implementation with date formatting
     - Fixed duplicate variable declarations causing initialization errors
   - Fixed duplicate function implementations
   - Corrected element ID mismatches

4. **Improved error handling**:
   - Enhanced data loading error handling
   - Added graceful fallbacks for missing files
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages

5. **Added comprehensive testing**:
   - Created unit tests for data processing functions
   - Added tests for historical data analysis
   - Implemented testing infrastructure for future development

6. **Created script.js refactoring plan**:
   - Developed a comprehensive plan to break down the 5500+ line script.js file into smaller modules
   - Defined a modular structure with clear responsibility separation
   - Outlined a phased migration approach to maintain functionality throughout the process
   - Planned to address existing linter errors during the refactoring

## Next Development Focus

1. **Code Refactoring**: Breaking down the large script.js file into smaller ES6 modules for better maintainability.

2. **Advanced Analytics**: Adding more sophisticated statistical models for player analysis and performance prediction.

3. **User Customization**: Allowing users to customize their dashboard views and save preferences.

4. **Export Functionality**: Implementing options to export tables, charts, and reports.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Enhancing application performance with larger datasets and more complex visualizations.

## Known Issues

- ~~JavaScript errors preventing app initialization~~ FIXED
- ~~Error with missing element reference for "historySection"~~ FIXED
- ~~Weekly data loading errors (determineLatestWeek and fetchCSVData undefined)~~ FIXED
- Several linter errors in script.js (to be fixed during refactoring)
- Loading speed could be optimized for large datasets
- Chart visualizations could be improved for small screens
- Mobile navigation needs additional testing
