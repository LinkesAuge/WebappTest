# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are enhancing the analytics capabilities of the ChefScore dashboard with additional features to analyze weekly changes in player performance. The application provides a responsive and interactive interface for visualizing Total Battle chest scores and other performance metrics.

## Recent Changes

1. **Fixed Critical JavaScript Errors**:
   - Fixed undefined `historySection` reference in `switchView` function
   - Added missing `resetAnalyticsView` function implementation
   - Implemented the `initWeeklyDataSystem` function to properly load and manage weekly data
   - Fixed weekly data loading system by:
     - Refactoring `detectAvailableWeeks` to not rely on `determineLatestWeek`
     - Updating `loadWeekData` to use the existing `loadStaticCsvData` function
     - Adding proper week selector implementation with date formatting
     - Fixing duplicate variable declarations causing initialization errors
   - Added missing translation keys for initialization error messages
   - Updated DOM element references to include history-related UI elements

2. **Automated Tooling and Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Created update_weeks_json.js script for automatic updating of weeks.json when new weekly data is added
   - Added batch file for easy execution of update tasks
   - Improved console logging for easier debugging

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error display functions with consistent messaging
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks for missing data files
   - Added better user feedback during initialization and loading processes

## Development Priorities

1. **More robust error handling** - The application has been enhanced with better error handling, particularly for missing data files and data loading edge cases
2. **Automated tooling** - Tools have been created to streamline the weekly data update process
3. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Test-driven development approach has been implemented for new features
4. **User experience improvements** - Week selection UI has been improved with proper navigation and history view
5. **Performance optimization** - Data caching mechanisms have been implemented to improve load times

## Key Decisions

1. **Test-driven development approach**: All new features are being built with tests first, ensuring reliability and maintainability.
2. **Weekly data file organization**: Weekly data files follow a consistent naming pattern (`data_week_XX.csv`) and are indexed through a central `weeks.json` file.
3. **Automation over manual processes**: An auto-updating script has been created to maintain the `weeks.json` file, reducing manual work.
4. **Enhanced error handling**: All data loading functions now include robust error handling.
5. **Browser compatibility focus**: The application has been tested across different browsers to ensure consistent functionality.

## Implementation Plan

The multi-week data feature has been successfully implemented following this phased approach:

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE
- Created test data files and index structure
- Built test infrastructure for data loading

### Phase 2: ✅ COMPLETE
- Implemented core week detection functionality
- Added data loading functions for specific weeks
- Created fallback mechanisms for weeks.json

### Phase 3: ✅ COMPLETE
- Built UI components for week selection
- Added navigation between weekly data sets
- Implemented caching for improved performance

### Phase 4: ✅ COMPLETE
- Created historical data processing functions
- Built history view with trend visualization
- Added player tracking across multiple weeks

### Phase 5: ✅ COMPLETE
- Added auto-updating scripts for weeks.json
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Review loading sequences for potential performance improvements
   - Optimize chart rendering for large datasets
   - Implement lazy loading for history visualization components

2. **Additional Analytics Features**:
   - Implement player comparison tool
   - Create advanced filtering capabilities for historical data
   - Develop week-over-week change highlighting

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add tooltips and help text for new features
   - Optimize mobile experience for History view
