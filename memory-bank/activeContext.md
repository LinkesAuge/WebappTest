# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing the modular architecture to replace the large script.js file
- Completing the data handling phase and moving to UI & Interaction
- Improving code maintainability and organization
- Ensuring comprehensive test coverage

## Recent Changes
- Consolidated all data processing functionality:
  - Merged redundant data processing files into a single module in js/data-processing/dataProcessing.js
  - Deleted proxy file for cleaner architecture
  - Updated all imports to reference the consolidated module directly
  - All tests updated to use the correct import path
- Successfully implemented core modules:
  - Completed Phase 1 (Setup & Proof of Concept) with basic structure
  - Completed Phase 2 (Core Framework) with state management, DOM, and i18n
  - Nearly completed Phase 3 (Data Handling) with data loading and processing
- Updated project documentation:
  - Revised implementation checklist to reflect current progress
  - Updated progress tracking in memory-bank
  - All 146 tests across 18 test suites are now passing

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining elements of Phase 3 (Data Handling):
  - Finalize main.js initialization sequence
- Begin implementation of Phase 4: UI & Interaction
  - Create the listeners.js module and submodules
  - Complete the ui-updates modules for all UI components
  - Connect UI components to the state management system
- Develop additional tests for UI components and interactions
- Continue implementing the modular architecture per the implementation checklist

## Key Decisions
- Using ES6 module system for code organization
- Standardizing on ApexCharts for all chart rendering
- Supporting modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Serving ES6 modules directly without bundling
- Implementing a custom pub/sub state management pattern
- Creating a single entry point (main.js)
- Consolidating data processing into a single module with clean interfaces

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain consistent import paths across the application
- Focus on completing UI modules in a logical order
- Test interactive components thoroughly
- Maintain test coverage above 90% as we implement new modules
- Plan for eventual removal of script.js reference

## Timeline Expectations
- ✓ Phase 1 (Setup & Proof of Concept): Completed
- ✓ Phase 2 (Core Framework): Completed  
- ⏳ Phase 3 (Data Handling): Near completion
- Phase 4 (UI & Interaction): 2-3 days
- Phase 5 (Chart Implementation): 2-3 days
- Phase 6 (Integration & Testing): 3-4 days
- Estimated completion: 7-10 days
