# Progress

## What Works
- The application structure and HTML layout are complete
- The internationalization (i18n) system for German and English is implemented
- View switching mechanism is in place
- Data loading and parsing functions are implemented
- Chart rendering using ApexCharts is set up
- User interface with responsive design is complete

## What's Left to Build
- Fix the JavaScript linter error at lines 2084-2090
- Create or verify the data.csv file
- Create or verify the rules.csv file
- Test all features to ensure they function as described
- Create the icon.png and icon_xl.png files if needed

## Current Status (Last updated: 2024-09-12)

### Refactoring Plan
We've completed a comprehensive code review and developed a refactoring plan to modernize the codebase. The plan includes:

1. **Architecture Changes**
   - Move to ES6 module system
   - Implement proper folder structure
   - Create services, controllers, models, and views

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Fix linting issues with modern patterns
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use design patterns for complex configurations

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Improve data processing efficiency
   - Implement lazy loading for charts
   - Reduce redundant DOM operations

### Current Progress

#### Completed
- Code review and identification of issues
- Creation of sample data files for testing
- Creation of placeholder icon files
- Development of comprehensive refactoring plan
- Setup of basic folder structure for modular architecture
- Implementation of core services:
  - StateManager - Central state management with observer pattern
  - ErrorHandler - Centralized error handling
  - LanguageService - Internationalization service
  - DataService - Data loading and processing
  - UIService - UI handling and manipulation
- Implementation of key controllers:
  - AppController - Main application controller
  - NavigationController - Navigation handling
- Creation of integration guide (js/index.js)

#### In Progress
- Development of remaining controllers (AnalyticsController, PlayerController)
- Implementation of ChartService for chart rendering
- Design of data models for the application

### What's Left to Build/Fix

1. **Architecture Implementation**
   - Create the remaining controllers and services
   - Implement model classes for structured data
   - Integrate with the existing HTML
   - Replace direct DOM manipulation with component approach

2. **Code Quality**
   - Implement builder pattern for chart configurations
   - Add centralized error handling
   - Use event delegation for cleaner event handling

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Replace placeholder icons with final versions
   - Ensure consistent loading states
   - Improve error feedback to users

4. **Documentation**
   - Update code documentation to reflect new architecture
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Document API and component interfaces

### Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)** - Set up folder structure and initial modules
2. **Phase 2: Core Services (In Progress)** - Extract and implement data and language services
3. **Phase 3: State Management (Completed)** - Implement central state system
4. **Phase 4: Components (Next)** - Migrate UI components one by one
5. **Phase 5: Optimization (Planned)** - Performance improvements and refinements

### What Works
- Basic application structure
- Sample data loading
- Internationalization framework
- State management system
- Error handling infrastructure
- UI service utilities

### Known Issues
- Integration with HTML not yet implemented
- Chart rendering service not yet implemented
- Player details view not fully functional
- Missing controllers for analytics and players

## To-Do List

### High Priority
- [x] Review codebase
- [ ] Fix JavaScript linter error
- [ ] Create/verify data.csv
- [ ] Create/verify rules.csv

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create/verify icon files
- [ ] Test all application features
- [ ] Verify multilingual support works correctly

### Low Priority
- [ ] Consider code refactoring for maintainability
- [ ] Document any implementation details not covered in README
- [ ] Add comments to complex sections of code

## Notes for Future Work
- Consider modularizing the JavaScript code for better maintainability
- Add more robust error handling for edge cases
- Consider adding more features like historical data tracking or additional visualization options
- Explore options for automated data updates rather than manual CSV updates
