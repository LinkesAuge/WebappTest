# Bug Fixing and Improvements Log

## 2023-10-24: Fixed Weekly Data Loading Resilience

### Context
The application was failing to load weekly data with the error "Skipping historical data load as no weeks are available". This happened because the `weeks.json` file was either not found, couldn't be loaded, or wasn't being parsed correctly.

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Added Fallback Data
- Added hardcoded fallback data for weeks if `weeks.json` loading fails
- Implemented this in both `main.js` and `history.js` for redundancy
- Created a more resilient check for `availableWeeks` that handles null, undefined, and non-array cases

#### 2. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging in the `loadAvailableWeeks` function to help diagnose the issue
- Added step-by-step logging to track the progress of data loading
- Improved error reporting with full stack traces

#### 3. Fixed Array Initialization
- Added proper checks to ensure `availableWeeks` is always an array before accessing array methods
- Added graceful recovery by reinitializing arrays when needed

### Technical Notes
The main problem was that the application depended on the existence of a properly formatted `weeks.json` file, but didn't have adequate fallback mechanisms when this file was missing or corrupted. The fix implements several layers of fallback strategies:

1. Try to load `weeks.json` normally
2. If that fails, create hardcoded fallback data
3. Calculate date ranges for the fallback data using the `getWeekDateRange` function
4. Continue with the application using the fallback data

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding a data validation step for `weeks.json`
- Implement automatic recovery when data files are missing or corrupted
- Create a UI mechanism to add/edit week data directly
- Store a backup of weeks data in localStorage
- Implement a more robust approach to handle file system errors

## 2023-10-24: Fixed Data Loading and Week Selector Issues

### Context
While the week selector was now visible and populated with weeks, the application wasn't properly loading or displaying the data from the selected week. The console logs showed:

- `TypeError: history.handleWeekChange is not a function`
- `Error initializing weekly data: TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'id')`
- Missing translation keys `week.latest` and `weekSelector.week`
- Multiple DOM elements not found when setting up event listeners

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Global State Management
- Fixed `currentWeek` initialization by exporting it as a proper module variable
- Added proper error handling in initialization functions
- Fixed object type checking to prevent null reference errors

#### 2. Module Import/Export Issues
- Updated import statements in `listeners.js` to properly import the history module
- Fixed event handlers to directly call `switchWeek` instead of the non-existent `handleWeekChange`
- Added try/catch blocks around all async code to prevent unhandled promise rejections

#### 3. Missing Translation Keys
- Added missing translations for:
  - `week.latest`: "Neueste" (DE) / "Latest" (EN)
  - `weekSelector.week`: "Woche" (DE) / "Week" (EN)
  - `weekSelector.noWeeks`: "Keine Wochen verfügbar" (DE) / "No weeks available" (EN)
  - `weekSelector.loading`: "Lade Woche-Daten..." (DE) / "Loading week data..." (EN)

#### 4. DOM Element References
- Replaced references to the `elements` object with direct `document.getElementById` calls
- Added better error handling when DOM elements aren't found
- Added success logging for setup functions to improve debugging

#### 5. Enhanced UI Updates
- Completely rewrote the `updateUIWithWeekData` function to:
  - Properly identify properties in different data formats (CSV or JSON)
  - Calculate correct totals and averages
  - Update dashboard statistics
  - Populate the ranking table with current week's data
  - Update charts with current data

### Technical Notes
The main issue was that the week selector was working but not properly triggering the data loading and display. The fixed implementation now:

1. Properly initializes the `currentWeek` as a module-level variable
2. Correctly handles the week change events
3. Properly loads and parses CSV data files
4. Updates the UI elements with the loaded data
5. Adds better error handling at all critical points

### Future Considerations
1. **Unified Data Format**: Consider standardizing the data format between CSV and JSON files to simplify handling
2. **Centralized DOM Access**: Create a better DOM access abstraction to avoid direct getElementById calls
3. **Event Bus**: Implement a proper event system for cross-module communication
4. **Loading States**: Add better visual feedback during data loading operations

## 2023-10-24: Fixed CSV File Path Handling

### Context
After implementing the CSV-based weekly data structure, the application was still attempting to load from incorrect paths. The console errors showed attempts to access:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5500/data/12`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5500/data/13` 
- `http://127.0.0.1:5500/data/14`

Instead of the correct paths with the full CSV filenames:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5500/data/data_week_12.csv`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5500/data/data_week_13.csv`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5500/data/data_week_14.csv`

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Incorrect Path Reference in `loadHistoricalData`
- In `history.js`, the `loadHistoricalData` function was using the week ID (`weekId`) to construct file paths
- Updated to use the `file` property from the week object instead, which contains the correct CSV filename

#### 2. Missing Error Handling in `switchWeek`
- The `switchWeek` function was using a non-existent `path` property instead of the `file` property
- Added checks to ensure the week object has a `file` property before attempting to load data
- Improved null checks for the `currentWeek` object to prevent "Cannot set properties of null" errors

#### 3. Improved Null Handling in `initializeWeeklyData`
- Added initialization of the `currentWeek` object if it doesn't already exist
- Added proper type checking to avoid "Cannot set properties of null" errors
- Improved error messaging to help diagnose issues

### Technical Notes
The application now correctly handles the path construction for CSV files:
1. `weeks.json` specifies the full filename (e.g., "data_week_12.csv")
2. `loadHistoricalData` and `switchWeek` use that filename when calling `loadWeekData`
3. `loadWeekData` constructs the correct path using the filename

### Future Considerations
1. **Path Construction**: Consider centralizing path construction in a utility function
2. **Error Recovery**: Add more robust recovery mechanisms for file loading failures
3. **Logging Enhancement**: Add more detailed logging to help diagnose path issues
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching to reduce repeated failed requests

## 2023-10-24: Simplified Week Data Structure

### Context
The `weeks.json` file contained redundant date ranges (startDate and endDate) that could be calculated dynamically based on week numbers. This redundancy increased the chance of errors and made the file unnecessarily complex.

### Changes Made
- Removed the `startDate` and `endDate` properties from entries in `weeks.json`
- Now relying entirely on the `getWeekDateRange()` function to calculate these values dynamically
- The `loadAvailableWeeks()` function already had logic to calculate missing date ranges

### Benefits
- Simplified data structure with less redundancy
- Reduced chance of errors from manually entered date ranges
- Consistent date calculations based on ISO week standards
- More maintainable `weeks.json` file with fewer properties to update

### Technical Notes
The application now follows this workflow for week data:
1. `weeks.json` only needs to specify the week number and filename
2. Date ranges are calculated automatically using the ISO week number rules
3. All calculations use the current year as the basis for dates

## 2023-10-24: Enhanced Week Data Handling with CSV Files

### Context
The application was designed to use CSV files for weekly data rather than JSON files, but the implementation was not fully aligned with this requirement. We needed to update the system to:
1. Extract week numbers from filenames (e.g., "data_week_12.csv" → "12")
2. Dynamically calculate date ranges for calendar weeks in the current year
3. Use existing CSV files for weekly data instead of JSON files

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Enhanced Date Range Calculation
- Added `getWeekDateRange()` function to `utils.js` that calculates start and end dates for any calendar week in the current year
- This provides dynamic date ranges based on the week number extracted from filenames

#### 2. Updated Weekly Data Loading
- Modified `loadWeekData()` to handle CSV files for weekly data
- Added logic to extract week numbers from filenames (e.g., "data_week_12.csv" → "12")
- Implemented CSV parsing for weekly data files
- Added calculation of totals (score, dishes, etc.) for aggregated weekly statistics

#### 3. Fixed `weeks.json` Implementation
- Updated `weeks.json` to reference CSV files instead of JSON files
- Enhanced `loadAvailableWeeks()` to calculate date ranges for weeks if not explicitly provided

### Technical Notes
The updated implementation now supports the following data flow:
1. `weeks.json` contains references to CSV files (e.g., "data_week_12.csv")
2. The application extracts week numbers from filenames
3. Date ranges are calculated dynamically based on the current year's calendar
4. CSV files are loaded and parsed for weekly player data
5. Totals are calculated for aggregated statistics

### Future Considerations
1. **Caching**: Add caching mechanism for calculated date ranges
2. **Alternative Formats**: Support multiple data formats (CSV, JSON) with format detection
3. **Historical Data**: Add support for specifying years for historical data

## 2023-10-24: Added Missing Data Files

### Context
The application was failing to load properly due to missing data files. Console errors showed:
- "No available weeks found" when trying to load weekly data
- "No available weeks to load historical data"
- Multiple DOM elements not found
- Charts not rendering

The application expected data files in the `data` directory but they were not present.

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Missing Data Files
- Created directory structure for data files (`data/weeks`)
- Added a `weeks.json` file with sample week data
- Created sample weekly data files (`data_week_12.csv`, `data_week_13.csv`, `data_week_14.csv`)
- Added a sample `rules.csv` file with scoring rules

### Technical Notes
The application requires a specific data structure to function properly:
- `data/weeks.json` - Lists all available weeks with metadata
- `data/*.csv` - Weekly data files with detailed statistics (format: `data_week_XX.csv`)
- `data/rules.csv` - Rules for calculating scores

### Future Considerations
1. **Data Validation**: Add schema validation for data files
2. **Backup/Restore**: Implement data backup and restore functionality
3. **Data Import UI**: Create a UI for importing data files
4. **Data Export**: Add functionality to export data in various formats

### Technical Debt
1. **Dynamic Data Loading**: Refactor to dynamically load data without requiring specific file structures
2. **Improved Empty States**: Enhance empty state handling for missing data
3. **Local Storage Fallback**: Implement better fallback mechanisms for when data files are not available

## 2023-10-23: Fixed Function Name Mismatch and DOM References

### Context
The application was failing to initialize properly with errors in the console.

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Function Name Mismatch
- Corrected a function call in `main.js` from `history.loadAllHistoricalData()` to `history.loadHistoricalData()`
- This fixed a TypeError that was preventing the application from initializing

#### 2. Missing DOM Elements
- Added null checks around DOM references to improve stability
- Ensured proper element existence checking before manipulation

#### 3. Chart Instances Management
- Introduced a `chartInstances` object to track chart instances
- Added cleanup of existing charts to prevent memory leaks
- Improved chart recreation logic

#### 4. Error Handling in Data Loading Functions
- Enhanced data loading functions to handle missing files gracefully
- Improved error messaging to provide better user feedback
- Added fallback returns (empty arrays) to prevent cascading errors

#### 5. Week Detection Logic
- Improved the logic in `determineLatestWeek` to be more robust
- Enhanced date parsing and comparison for more accurate week detection

### Testing Improvements

#### 1. Historical Data Tests
- Fixed failing tests in `historical-data.test.js`
- Separated DOM setup from Jest mocks to prevent "document not defined" errors
- Improved mock implementations of `parseCSV` and state management functions

#### 2. Week Detection Tests
- Updated tests to properly mock date functions
- Aligned tests with the new function behaviors

#### 3. Overall Test Framework
- Achieved a fully passing test suite with 102 tests across 13 suites
- Enhanced error handling in tests to better diagnose issues
- Improved test coverage for edge cases

### Future Considerations
1. **Robustness**: Further enhance error handling and fallbacks
2. **Caching**: Implement proper caching for loaded data
3. **Loading Indicators**: Add more detailed loading progress indicators
4. **Performance**: Optimize chart rendering for large datasets
5. **Test Coverage**: Expand unit test coverage for UI components

### Technical Debt
1. **Large Files**: Refactor the large `script.js` file into smaller modules
2. **UI Interactions**: Improve error handling in UI interactions
3. **Code Duplication**: Eliminate duplicated code in data handling functions

## 2023-10-23: Data Loading Robustness Improvements

### Context
The application was failing to load properly in certain situations when data files were not available. Tests were also failing due to improper handling of error conditions and DOM references in mock functions.

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Function Name Mismatch
- **Issue**: In `main.js`, there was a call to `history.loadAllHistoricalData()` but the function in `history.js` was actually named `loadHistoricalData()`.
- **Fix**: Updated the function call in `

## Bugs and Solutions

### April 1, 2023

#### Multi-week Data Feature Fixes

1. **Fixed "Assignment to constant variable" error in listeners.js**
   - Problem: The `currentView` was imported directly from state.js as a constant but being modified
   - Solution: Imported the entire state module and accessed `currentView` as a property (`state.currentView`)

2. **Fixed duplicate function definition in history.js**
   - Problem: The `updateUIWithWeekData` function was defined twice (once as local, once as exported)
   - Solution: Converted the first occurrence to an exported function and removed the duplicate

3. **Fixed week selector population and data loading**
   - Problem: The `loadWeekData` function was being called with the wrong parameter format
   - Solution: Updated `handleWeekChange` to pass `selectedWeek.file` instead of the whole `selectedWeek` object

4. **Fixed inconsistent variable naming**
   - Problem: References to `weekSelect` vs `weekSelector` causing selector issues
   - Solution: Standardized all references to the same element ID

5. **Fixed Fallback Week Data**
   - Problem: When weeks.json couldn't be loaded, the fallback week data wasn't being properly created.
   - Solution: Added proper initialization of state.availableWeeks, ensures it's an array before adding items, and improved the fallback logic.

6. **Fixed loadWeekData Parameter Issues**
   - Problem: When calling loadWeekData, the parameter was sometimes wrong or inconsistently formatted.
   - Solution: Updated switchWeek function to properly log and validate the weekInfo.file parameter before passing it.

7. **Fixed Error Handling**
   - Problem: Silent failures occurred when week data wasn't available due to missing error messages.
   - Solution: Added comprehensive error logging and user-facing error messages at all potential failure points.

8. **Fixed currentWeek Object Reference**
   - Problem: When initializing currentWeek as a window variable, it wasn't updating the state module's variable.
   - Solution: Added explicit synchronization between window.currentWeek and state.currentWeek.

9. **Fixed State Module Import Issues**
   - Problem: Import issues in history.js where both direct imports and namespace imports were causing conflicts.
   - Solution: Updated imports to consistently use the namespace import for state to ensure we're accessing the same instance of state variables.

10. **Fixed currentWeek Initialization**
   - Problem: currentWeek was being set to null in state.js but was expected to be an object in other files.
   - Solution: Changed initialization in state.js to use an empty object instead of null, preventing null reference errors.

11. **Fixed Week Selector Population**
   - Problem: Week selector wasn't showing weeks properly because the selector element ID was inconsistent.
   - Solution: Updated all references to use consistent ID 'weekSelector' and added better debugging for when it's not found.
