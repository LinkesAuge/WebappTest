# Project Progress Report

## Overall Status

The project is in a transition phase from "Chest Analyzer" to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard" with a focus on implementing a proper folder structure, creating testing infrastructure from scratch, and enhancing features.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Infrastructure

- [x] Set up Jest testing framework
- [x] Created initial test files for unit and integration testing
- [x] Created test setup file with proper DOM mocking and browser API mocks
- [x] Implemented TextEncoder and TextDecoder polyfills for JSDOM testing environment

### Code Modularization

- [x] Modularized code into separate files:
  - [x] `dataLoader.js` - Handles data fetching and processing
  - [x] `domManager.js` - Manages DOM references and UI operations
  - [x] `i18n.js` - Handles internationalization
  - [x] `utils.js` - Contains utility functions
  - [x] `app.js` - Core application logic

- [x] Implemented proper module exports and imports
- [x] Created clear separation of concerns between modules

### Testing Infrastructure

- [x] Set up Jest testing environment with proper DOM mocking
- [x] Created mocks for browser APIs (localStorage, fetch, etc.)
- [x] Successfully implemented working tests for `dataLoader.js` module
- [x] Implemented internationalization tests with mock DOM and localStorage
- [x] Created test documentation in memory-bank/testing.md

## In Progress

### Testing

- [ ] Fix DOM mocking issues in tests for `utils.js` and `domManager.js`
- [ ] Resolve test failures in `app.test.js`
- [ ] Update tests for empty test suites (tableRenderer, chartRenderer, etc.)
- [ ] Address integration test references to undefined properties

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments to reflect current implementation
- [ ] Enhance test documentation with examples for each test type

## Planned Tasks

### Testing

- [ ] Achieve 90%+ test coverage across all modules
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests
- [ ] Add performance tests for critical functions

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add more advanced data visualization
- [ ] Implement data export features
- [ ] Add user preference persistence

### Code Quality

- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling
- [ ] Optimize performance

## Completed Features

- [x] Dashboard view with player rankings and statistics
- [x] Detailed player statistics and breakdown views
- [x] Data importing and processing from CSV files
- [x] Multiple chart visualizations (donut, bar, scatter, radar)
- [x] Sorting and filtering capabilities
- [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Multi-language support (German and English)
- [x] Local storage persistence for language preference
- [x] Top chest sources visualization
- [x] Score distribution analysis
- [x] Score vs. chest count correlation visualization
- [x] Category-specific analysis
- [x] Basic development environment setup (.babelrc, .eslintrc, package.json)

## Pending Features

- [ ] Folder structure reorganization
- [ ] Testing infrastructure implementation
- [ ] Complete test coverage (target >95%)
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Export functionality for generated charts
- [ ] Additional chart types for deeper analysis
- [ ] Performance optimization for larger datasets
- [ ] Enhanced filter options
- [ ] Extended category analysis tools
- [ ] Modular codebase structure
- [ ] Automated build process

## Known Issues

- Tests for `utils.js` failing due to issues with document.createElement mocking
- DOM element mocking in `domManager.js` tests causing test failures
- Integration tests failing due to missing references to components
- Several empty test suites that need implementation

## Milestones

| Milestone | Status | Notes |

| Test Coverage | 🔄 In Progress | Current progress: 1 module fully tested, others partially working |
| Documentation | 🔄 In Progress | Core documentation created, needs updates to reflect current state |
| Feature Enhancements | ⏳ Not Started | Will begin after testing is stabilized |
| Production Release | ⏳ Not Started | Pending completion of testing and feature enhancements |

## Recent Updates

### Test Fixes (Current Work)
We've made significant progress on fixing test failures:
1. Fixed JSDOM initialization with proper TextEncoder and TextDecoder polyfills
2. Corrected i18n.test.js file to properly mock language functions and DOM
3. Implemented proper mocking for domManager.js without referencing document in factory functions
4. Resolved issues with test setup to allow consistent environment across tests

### Next Steps
1. Continue fixing test failures in utils.test.js and app.test.js
2. Implement missing tests for the empty test suites
3. Create proper mocks for integration tests

### Current Test Stats
- Total test suites: 11
- Passing test suites: 1 (dataLoader.test.js)
- Tests passing: 46 of 67 total

## Performance Metrics

- Initial load time: ~1.5 seconds with typical dataset
- Chart rendering: ~0.3-0.5 seconds
- Data processing: ~0.5 seconds for current dataset size
- Mobile responsiveness: Good on most devices
- Current test coverage: 0% (no tests currently available)
