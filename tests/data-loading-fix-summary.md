# Data Loading Issues and Fixes

## Identified Issues

1. **Syntax Error in `history.js`**: 
   - An extra closing bracket in the `initializeWeeklyData()` function after a try-catch block caused a syntax error that broke the execution.
   - This syntax error was difficult to detect through static code analysis tools because it required parsing the entire JavaScript file.

2. **DOM Element References**:
   - The week selector element (`weekSelector`) couldn't be found, as logged by the listeners.js file in the console.
   - The app was not properly setting up element references for the week selector.

3. **State Management Issues**:
   - State variables like `availableWeeks` and `currentWeek` were not properly initialized or updated.
   - The application tried to modify immutable export bindings in some cases.

4. **Data Flow Issues**:
   - The data loading flow was not correctly handling the loading of weeks.json and then the specific week data.
   - The error logs showed "Skipping historical data load as no weeks are available" which indicated a problem in the chain of loading operations.

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Fixed Syntax Error**: 
   - Created a completely new implementation of `history.js` as `historyNew.js` with proper syntax.
   - Updated the main.js file to import from historyNew.js instead of history.js.

2. **Created Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Added unit tests for the data loading functionality in `tests/unit/data-loading/data-loading.test.js`.
   - Added tests to verify DOM structure requirements in `tests/unit/data-loading/dom-structure.test.js`.
   - Created integration tests for the full data loading process in `tests/integration/data-loading-integration.test.js`.

3. **Added Debugging Tools**:
   - Created a standalone HTML debug tool `tests/data-loading-debug.html` to test data loading in isolation.
   - Added a test script `tests/test-load-weeks.js` to verify weeks loading.

4. **Fixed State Management**:
   - Ensured proper initialization of state variables like `availableWeeks` and `currentWeek`.
   - Used consistent patterns for updating state variables across modules.

5. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added better error handling throughout the data loading process.
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks when weeks.json or week data files are missing.

## Validation Strategy

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Use the data-loading-debug.html tool to verify that:
     - weeks.json can be loaded successfully
     - individual week data files can be loaded
     - the week selector is populated correctly
     - historical data is loaded

2. **Test Suite Execution**:
   - Run the unit tests to verify individual components
   - Run the integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow

3. **Browser Console Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the browser console for any errors during data loading
   - Verify that proper logging occurs at each step of the process

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Add more specific error messages and recovery mechanisms

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Increase test coverage for edge cases like malformed data files

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider caching mechanisms for faster loading of weekly data

4. **UI Feedback**:
   - Improve the loading indicators and error messages in the UI
