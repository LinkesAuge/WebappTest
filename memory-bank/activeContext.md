# Active Context

## Current Focus (Last updated: 2024-09-12)

We are currently implementing the refactoring plan for the TB Chest Analyzer application. The focus is on establishing the new modular architecture with proper separation of concerns.

### Implementation Progress

1. **Architecture Setup**
   - ✅ Created the folder structure for the modular architecture
   - ✅ Implemented key services:
     - StateManager - Central state management with observer pattern
     - ErrorHandler - Centralized error handling
     - LanguageService - Internationalization service
     - DataService - Data loading and processing
     - UIService - UI handling and manipulation
   - ✅ Implemented key controllers:
     - AppController - Main application controller
     - NavigationController - Navigation handling

2. **Next Services/Components to Implement**
   - ChartService - For chart rendering and management
   - AnalyticsController - Handling analytics view and data
   - PlayerController - Handling player view and interactions
   - Models - Player, Alliance, and ServerData models

### Implementation Strategy

We're following an incremental approach:

1. Set up the architecture backbone (core services and controllers)
2. Extract functionality from the monolithic code piece by piece
3. Implement the central services first, then controllers and views
4. Replace direct DOM manipulation with component-based approach
5. Update the HTML to use the new modular structure

The incremental approach allows us to have a functional application at each step of the refactoring, making testing and validation easier.

### Recent Decisions

1. **State Management Pattern**: We've implemented a central state manager with observer pattern to replace global variables and simplify state management.

2. **Error Handling Strategy**: A centralized error handler provides consistent error handling, logging, and user feedback.

3. **UI Service Approach**: The UI service abstracts DOM manipulation and provides a consistent API for UI updates.

4. **Controller Hierarchy**: We've established a hierarchy with AppController at the top, coordinating between specialized controllers.

### Next Steps

1. Create the remaining controllers (AnalyticsController, PlayerController)
2. Implement the ChartService for chart rendering
3. Create model classes for data representation
4. Start migrating functionality from the original code to the new architecture
5. Update the HTML structure to use the new modular JavaScript files

## Recent Changes
- Initial review of the project codebase
- Identified a linter error in the JavaScript section of index.html:
  - Error at lines 2084-2090: "Declaration or statement expected" and "'}' expected"
  - This appears to be an issue with the closing bracket of a function or event listener

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Code Structure
- Maintain the current single-page application structure
- Keep using vanilla JavaScript for all functionality
- Continue with the client-side only approach

### UI/UX
- Preserve the existing dark fantasy theme inspired by "Total Battle"
- Maintain support for both German and English languages
- Ensure responsive design works across device sizes

### Data Processing
- Keep using PapaParse for CSV parsing
- Maintain the current data transformation approach
- Preserve the error handling strategy for CSV loading

### Visualizations
- Continue using ApexCharts for all data visualizations
- Ensure all charts render correctly with the proper data
- Maintain chart styling consistent with the application theme

### Current Issues
- Need to resolve the JavaScript linter error in index.html
- Need to verify data.csv and rules.csv are available and properly formatted
- Need to ensure all features function as documented

### Technical Debt
- The codebase uses global variables extensively, which could be refactored
- Error handling could be more consistent throughout the application
- Some functions are quite large and could be broken down for better maintainability
