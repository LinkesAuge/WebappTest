# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The ChefScore Dashboard is being enhanced with improved robustness and error handling. We've implemented multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure the application can continue functioning even when data files are missing or corrupted. The application can now recover gracefully from issues with the weeks.json file by using hardcoded fallback data.

The dashboard visualizes player data from chest collection activities, providing statistics, rankings, and various charts. Data loading is now extremely robust, with proper error handling, fallback mechanisms, and detailed logging. We have fixed issues with data loading and implemented multiple layers of protection to ensure a consistent user experience even in edge cases.

All 102 tests across 13 test suites are now passing successfully.

10. **Improved Week Detection Logic**:
    - Enhanced `determineLatestWeek` to sort by date or number
    - Updated `weeks.json` to reference CSV files
    - Added sample data files for development

11. **Added Documentation**:
    - Created bug fixing log
    - Updated progress tracking
    - Improved code comments

## Active Decisions

1. **CSV vs JSON for Weekly Data**: Using CSV files for weekly data for consistency with existing data pipeline.
2. **Data Folder Structure**: All weekly data files are stored in the `data/` directory.
3. **Week Identification**: Weeks are identified by sequential numbers, with date ranges calculated dynamically.
4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Focus on graceful degradation with informative error messages.
5. **State Management**: Centralized state variables in the state.js module.

## Open Questions

1. How can we optimize the loading process for large datasets?
2. Should we implement caching for historical data to improve performance?
3. What additional visualizations would be useful for week-over-week comparisons?
4. How should we handle data consistency issues across different weekly data files?

## Development Priorities

1. **Robust error handling** - Continue to enhance error handling, particularly for network issues and unexpected data formats
2. **Code refactoring** - Breaking down the large script.js file into smaller, more maintainable modules
3. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Test-driven development approach has been implemented with all tests now passing
4. **User experience improvements** - Better feedback for loading and error states
5. **Performance optimization** - Data caching and more efficient chart rendering
6. **Automated tooling** - Tools to streamline the weekly data update process
7. **Data format standardization** - Consistent handling of different data formats (CSV, JSON) with proper validation

## Key Decisions

1. **Graceful failure approach**: All data loading functions now return meaningful fallback values rather than throwing errors, allowing the application to continue functioning even with partial data.
2. **Consistent error messaging**: Standardized approach to error notifications for better user experience.
3. **Test fixture standardization**: Improved approach to mocking DOM elements and functions in tests to avoid scope issues.
4. **DOM element handling**: Implemented null checks and graceful fallbacks for all DOM element references.
5. **Chart instance tracking**: Added proper lifecycle management for chart instances to prevent memory leaks and rendering issues.
6. **CSV-based weekly data**: Updated the application to use CSV files for weekly data, with dynamic date calculation based on week numbers.
7. **Error documentation**: Created a detailed bug fixing log to track issues and their resolutions.

## Next Steps

1. **Script.js Refactoring**:
   - Begin Phase 1 of the refactoring plan by creating the module files
   - Move code incrementally to maintain functionality throughout the process
   - Test thoroughly after each step to ensure no functionality is broken

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Review loading sequences for potential performance improvements
   - Optimize chart rendering for large datasets
   - Implement lazy loading for history visualization components
   - Add caching for calculated date ranges

3. **Additional Analytics Features**:
   - Implement player comparison tool
   - Create advanced filtering capabilities for historical data
   - Develop week-over-week change highlighting

4. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add tooltips and help text for new features
   - Optimize mobile experience for History view
   - Enhance empty state design for better user guidance
   - Improve date and week number display consistency
