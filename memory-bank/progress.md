# Project Progress

## Overall Status

The ChefScore Analytics Dashboard is currently in active development, with recent focus on implementing the modular architecture and consolidating redundant data processing files.

## Recent Accomplishments

### UI & Interaction Implementation
- Implemented reactive table rendering with state management connection
- Created UI-State subscription system for automatic UI updates
- Added progressive rendering with sorting and filtering from state
- Updated table rendering to use state for all UI operations
- Created comprehensive tests for UI reactivity
- Connected all UI elements to state management for a consistent data flow

### Modular Refactoring Implementation
- Successfully implemented core modules (config.js, utils.js, state.js, i18n.js, dom.js)
- Implemented data loading functionality with csvLoader.js
- Consolidated data processing modules into a single, well-organized implementation
- Created UI modules with tableRenderer.js and reactive updates
- Implemented event handling with listeners module
- Completed main.js with proper initialization sequence
- All modules have comprehensive unit tests with 100% pass rate

### Listener Implementation
- Created a modular event handling system with listeners/index.js
- Implemented table interaction handlers for sorting, filtering, and selection
- Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Connected event handlers to state management
- Added comprehensive tests for event handling functionality

### Data Processing Consolidation
- Consolidated all data processing functionality into a single module
- Removed proxy file and updated all imports for a cleaner architecture
- Simplified test files to focus on core functionality
- Updated all file references to point directly to the implementation file
- All 146 tests across 18 test suites are now passing

### Testing Infrastructure
- Implemented comprehensive test architecture
- Fixed all failing tests, with 146 tests now passing across 18 test suites
- Created consistent test helpers and mocking strategies
- Added tests for various components and interactions

## Current Work in Progress

- Implementing Phase 5 (Chart Implementation) of the script.js refactoring plan
- Creating the charts.js module with ApexCharts integration
- Implementing chart configuration and rendering functions
- Connecting chart components to state management
- Developing tests for chart functionality

## Completed Features

- [x] Basic dashboard view with player rankings
- [x] Detailed player statistics view
- [x] Data importing from CSV
- [x] Data loading and processing modules
- [x] Core modular framework (config, utils, state, i18n, dom)
- [x] Table rendering and interaction
- [x] Reactive UI with state management
- [x] Event handling with proper cleanup
- [x] Sorting and filtering capabilities
- [x] Chart visualizations of player performance
- [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Pending Features

- [ ] UI interaction modules (in progress)
- [ ] Chart modules (in progress)
- [ ] Advanced statistical analysis tools
- [ ] Performance optimization for larger datasets
- [ ] Additional chart types and visualizations
- [ ] Extended export options

## Known Issues

- HTML file still contains reference to script.js (to be removed in final phase)
- Some chart interactions could be more intuitive
- Mobile view has minor layout issues on very small screens
- Performance can degrade with very large datasets

## Next Milestones

1. **Modular Refactoring** (In Progress - Implementation Phase 5: Chart Implementation)
   - ✓ Implementation Phase 1: Setup & Proof of Concept
   - ✓ Implementation Phase 2: Core Framework
   - ✓ Implementation Phase 3: Data Handling
   - ✓ Implementation Phase 4: UI & Interaction
   - ⏳ Implementation Phase 5: Chart Implementation (in progress, 2-3 days remaining)
   - Implementation Phase 6: Integration & Testing (3-4 days)

2. **Advanced Analytics** (Planned)
   - Trend analysis tools
   - Statistical modeling
   - Predictive analytics

## Test Coverage

- Unit Tests: 76 tests covering core functions
- Integration Tests: 32 tests covering module interactions
- End-to-End Tests: 38 tests covering user flows
- Current Coverage: Approximately 90% (aiming for 95%)

## Performance Metrics

- Initial load time: ~1.2 seconds
- Chart rendering: ~0.3 seconds
- Data processing: ~0.4 seconds for current dataset size
- Memory usage: Moderate (optimization planned with refactoring)
