# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are enhancing the analytics capabilities of the ChefScore dashboard with additional features to analyze weekly changes in player performance. The application provides a responsive and interactive interface for visualizing Total Battle chest scores and other performance metrics.

We are also working on refactoring the large script.js file into smaller, more maintainable modules using ES6 module system to address code maintainability issues and fix existing linter errors.

## Recent Changes

1. **Fixed Critical JavaScript Errors**:
   - Fixed undefined `historySection` reference in `switchView` function
   - Added missing `resetAnalyticsView` function implementation
   - Implemented the `initWeeklyDataSystem` function to properly load and manage weekly data
   - Fixed weekly data loading system by:
     - Refactoring `detectAvailableWeeks` to not rely on `determineLatestWeek`
     - Updating `loadWeekData` to use the existing `loadStaticCsvData` function
     - Adding proper week selector implementation with date formatting
     - Fixing duplicate variable declarations causing initialization errors
   - Added missing translation keys for initialization error messages
   - Updated DOM element references to include history-related UI elements

2. **Automated Tooling and Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Created update_weeks_json.js script for automatic updating of weeks.json when new weekly data is added
   - Added batch file for easy execution of update tasks
   - Improved console logging for easier debugging

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error display functions with consistent messaging
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks for missing data files
   - Added better user feedback during initialization and loading processes

4. **Code Refactoring Plan**:
   - Created a detailed plan to break down script.js into multiple modules
   - Defined a clear module structure for better organization and maintainability
   - Prepared migration approach to use ES6 modules
   - Planned to address existing linter errors during the refactoring process

## Development Priorities

1. **Code refactoring** - Breaking down the large script.js file into smaller, more maintainable modules
2. **More robust error handling** - The application has been enhanced with better error handling, particularly for missing data files and data loading edge cases
3. **Automated tooling** - Tools have been created to streamline the weekly data update process
4. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Test-driven development approach has been implemented for new features
5. **User experience improvements** - Week selection UI has been improved with proper navigation and history view
6. **Performance optimization** - Data caching mechanisms have been implemented to improve load times

## Key Decisions

1. **Modular code structure**: The large script.js file will be broken down into multiple ES6 modules, each with a specific responsibility.
2. **Test-driven development approach**: All new features are being built with tests first, ensuring reliability and maintainability.
3. **Weekly data file organization**: Weekly data files follow a consistent naming pattern (`data_week_XX.csv`) and are indexed through a central `weeks.json` file.
4. **Automation over manual processes**: An auto-updating script has been created to maintain the `weeks.json` file, reducing manual work.
5. **Enhanced error handling**: All data loading functions now include robust error handling.
6. **Browser compatibility focus**: The application has been tested across different browsers to ensure consistent functionality.

## Implementation Plan

The multi-week data feature has been successfully implemented following this phased approach:

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE
- Created test data files and index structure
- Built test infrastructure for data loading

### Phase 2: ✅ COMPLETE
- Implemented core week detection functionality
- Added data loading functions for specific weeks
- Created fallback mechanisms for weeks.json

### Phase 3: ✅ COMPLETE
- Built UI components for week selection
- Added navigation between weekly data sets
- Implemented caching for improved performance

### Phase 4: ✅ COMPLETE
- Created historical data processing functions
- Built history view with trend visualization
- Added player tracking across multiple weeks

### Phase 5: ✅ COMPLETE
- Added auto-updating scripts for weeks.json
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added comprehensive documentation

The script.js refactoring will be implemented in the following phases:

### Phase 1: ⬜ PENDING
- Create the `js/` directory and all module files
- Initialize each file with basic export structure
- Update `index.html` to load `main.js` as a module

### Phase 2: ⬜ PENDING
- Move configuration, utility functions, state management, i18n, and DOM references to their respective modules

### Phase 3: ⬜ PENDING
- Move data loading, data processing, event listeners, and UI update functions to their respective modules

### Phase 4: ⬜ PENDING
- Move chart rendering and historical data handling to their modules
- Organize initialization and main flow in main.js

### Phase 5: ⬜ PENDING
- Test all functionality to ensure it works as before
- Fix any issues that arise during testing
- Remove the original script.js file once everything is working

## Next Steps

1. **Script.js Refactoring**:
   - Begin Phase 1 of the refactoring plan by creating the module files
   - Move code incrementally to maintain functionality throughout the process
   - Test thoroughly after each step to ensure no functionality is broken

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Review loading sequences for potential performance improvements
   - Optimize chart rendering for large datasets
   - Implement lazy loading for history visualization components

3. **Additional Analytics Features**:
   - Implement player comparison tool
   - Create advanced filtering capabilities for historical data
   - Develop week-over-week change highlighting

4. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add tooltips and help text for new features
   - Optimize mobile experience for History view
