# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Completing the modular refactoring plan
- Implementing Phase 6: Integration & Final Testing
- Finalizing all modules and ensuring they work together seamlessly
- Completing documentation and tests

## Recent Changes
- Completed Phase 5: Chart Implementation
- Created a modular chart structure using ApexCharts:
  - Added `chartConfig.js` for standardized chart configuration
  - Implemented `chartUtils.js` for chart instance management
  - Created specialized chart modules (sourceCharts.js, correlationCharts.js, playerCharts.js)
  - Created main `charts.js` module with initialization and cleanup functions
- Connected charts to state management for reactivity
- Added comprehensive tests for all chart modules
- Updated main.js to initialize and use the chart modules

## Next Steps
1. Complete Integration (Phase 6)
   - Ensure all modules work together correctly
   - Complete documentation for all modules
   - Finalize any remaining connections between modules
2. Perform Final Testing
   - Run end-to-end tests
   - Verify all edge cases
   - Test in different browsers
3. Performance Optimization
   - Profile application performance
   - Optimize critical functions
   - Add caching where appropriate

## Timeline Expectations
- Phase 1: Core Utilities (Complete)
- Phase 2: State Management (Complete)
- Phase 3: Data Handling (Complete)
- Phase 4: UI & Interaction (Complete)
- Phase 5: Chart Implementation (Complete)
- Phase 6: Integration & Final Testing (In Progress)
  - Expected completion time: 1-2 days
  
The entire project is now approximately 80-85% complete, with an estimated total completion time of 6-9 days from the start.
