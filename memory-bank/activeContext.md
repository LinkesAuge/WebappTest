# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Transitioning from "Chest Analyzer" to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard"
- Building testing infrastructure from scratch (all previous tests deleted)
- Restructuring project folder organization
- Improving user experience on mobile devices
- Ensuring accuracy of data visualization and analysis

## Recent Changes
- Removed all previous tests to start fresh with a proper testing approach
- Set up modern development environment with Babel and ESLint
- Added configuration files (.babelrc, .eslintrc, package.json)
- Implemented responsive design for better mobile compatibility
- Added chart expansion feature for more detailed analysis
- Improved sorting functionality in tables
- Enhanced internationalization support for German and English

## Next Steps
- Create app/ folder structure and move files according to planned architecture
- Implement testing infrastructure from scratch
- Develop initial tests following test-driven development approach
- Achieve >95% test coverage as per project requirements
- Finalize the transition to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard"
- Consider adding more visualization types for deeper analysis
- Improve error handling for malformed CSV data
- Optimize chart rendering for better performance
- Explore adding download options for visualization results
- Integrate testing with CI/CD pipeline

## Key Decisions
- Transitioning from "Chest Analyzer" to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard"
- Adopting test-driven development for all new features
- Planning to use pytest for all testing needs
- Using UV for dependency management
- Using ApexCharts for all visualization needs
- Implementing client-side only processing to eliminate server dependencies
- Supporting only modern browsers to enable use of latest JavaScript features
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling to speed up development
- Storing language preference in localStorage

## Technical Considerations
- Migration strategy from flat structure to modular architecture
- Balancing between maintaining the existing functionality and adding new features
- Potential optimization of the large script.js file (approximately 4000+ lines)
- Browser compatibility for various chart interaction features
- Memory usage when processing large datasets
- Performance of chart rendering and table operations
- Proper path handling when moving files to new folder structure

## Timeline Expectations
- Create folder structure and move files within 1 week
- Set up testing infrastructure and implement initial tests within 2-3 weeks
- Finalize transition to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard" within 1 month
- Ongoing maintenance as needed
- Feature additions based on user feedback and requirements
