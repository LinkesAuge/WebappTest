# Project Progress Report

## Overall Status

The project is in a transition phase from "Chest Analyzer" to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard" with a focus on implementing a proper folder structure, creating testing infrastructure from scratch, and enhancing features. Recently, we've made significant progress in fixing critical initialization and data loading issues.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Infrastructure

- [x] Set up Jest testing framework
- [x] Created initial test files for unit and integration testing
- [x] Created test setup file with proper DOM mocking and browser API mocks
- [x] Implemented TextEncoder and TextDecoder polyfills for JSDOM testing environment

### Code Modularization

- [x] Modularized code into separate files:
  - [x] `dataLoader.js` - Handles data fetching and processing
  - [x] `domManager.js` - Manages DOM references and UI operations
  - [x] `i18n.js` - Handles internationalization
  - [x] `utils.js` - Contains utility functions
  - [x] `app.js` - Core application logic

- [x] Implemented proper module exports and imports
- [x] Created clear separation of concerns between modules

### Testing Infrastructure

- [x] Set up Jest testing environment with proper DOM mocking
- [x] Created mocks for browser APIs (localStorage, fetch, etc.)
- [x] Successfully implemented working tests for `dataLoader.js` module
- [x] Implemented internationalization tests with mock DOM and localStorage
- [x] Created test documentation in memory-bank/testing.md

### Recent Bug Fixes

- [x] Fixed initialization issues in the core application:
  - [x] Corrected initialization order in `app.js` to ensure utils are properly loaded before use
  - [x] Fixed `dashboardSortState` initialization to prevent "Cannot read properties of null" errors
  - [x] Properly set up utility function references in `dataLoader.js`
  - [x] Improved error handling in data loading process

- [x] Fixed data cleaning and processing:
  - [x] Enhanced handling of numeric values in CSV data
  - [x] Added proper validation for core columns like TOTAL_SCORE and CHEST_COUNT
  - [x] Improved error handling for invalid player data
  - [x] Fixed column missing errors during sorting

- [x] Fixed UI rendering issues:
  - [x] Improved sort icon initialization and visibility in tables
  - [x] Enhanced rendering of sortable columns and their indicators
  - [x] Fixed issues with UI updates after data loading

## In Progress

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments to reflect current implementation
- [ ] Enhance test documentation with examples for each test type

## Planned Tasks

- [x] Multiple chart visualizations (donut, bar, scatter, radar)
- [x] Sorting and filtering capabilities
- [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Multi-language support (German and English)
- [x] Local storage persistence for language preference
- [x] Top chest sources visualization
- [x] Score distribution analysis
- [x] Score vs. chest count correlation visualization
- [x] Category-specific analysis
- [x] Basic development environment setup (.babelrc, .eslintrc, package.json)
- [x] Fixed module initialization and cross-module utility usage
- [x] Enhanced data processing and cleaning routines
- [x] Improved sorting functionality and visual indicators

## Pending Features

- [ ] Folder structure reorganization

## Recent Updates

### Bug Fixes (Completed)
We've fixed several critical issues in the application:
1. Fixed initialization order in `app.js` to ensure proper loading of utilities before use
2. Improved data cleaning in `dataLoader.js` to handle numeric values and validation correctly
3. Enhanced sorting functionality and sorting icon visibility
4. Fixed issues with cross-module utility references
5. Improved error handling throughout the data loading process

### Test Fixes (Current Work)
We've made significant progress on fixing test failures:
1. Fixed JSDOM initialization with proper TextEncoder and TextDecoder polyfills
2. Corrected i18n.test.js file to properly mock language functions and DOM
3. Implemented proper mocking for domManager.js without referencing document in factory functions
4. Resolved issues with test setup to allow consistent environment across tests

### Next Steps
1. Continue fixing test failures in utils.test.js and app.test.js
2. Implement missing tests for the empty test suites
3. Create proper mocks for integration tests
4. Further refine error handling and edge cases

### Current Test Stats

- Passing test suites: 1 (dataLoader.test.js)
- Tests passing: 46 of 67 total

## Performance Metrics

- Initial load time: ~1.5 seconds with typical dataset
- Chart rendering: ~0.3-0.5 seconds
- Data processing: ~0.5 seconds for current dataset size
