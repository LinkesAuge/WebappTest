# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The primary development focus for the ChefScore Analytics Dashboard is improving core functionality, expanding test coverage, and addressing bug fixes to ensure a stable, reliable application. We've successfully fixed all failing tests, with 94 tests now passing across 11 test suites (38 unit tests, 21 integration tests, and 30 end-to-end tests).

## Recent Changes

1. **Complete Test Framework Overhaul**: 
   - Implemented comprehensive standardized test architecture
   - Created `e2e-test-setup.js` helper for consistent test environment
   - Developed robust mocking strategies for browser APIs
   - Standardized DOM structure creation across test files
   - Implemented proper error handling in test flows

2. **Mocking Improvements**:
   - Created consistent Chart.js mock implementation
   - Implemented reliable localStorage mock with proper error simulation
   - Developed standardized DOM event simulation
   - Added consistent console mocking for error testing

3. **Test Coverage Expansion**:
   - Added tests for player detail error handling
   - Expanded dashboard interaction tests (filtering, sorting, ranking)
   - Created comprehensive chart interaction test suite
   - Added responsive UI tests for mobile/desktop views

4. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed localStorage persistence test issues
   - Addressed language switching functionality tests
   - Fixed view transitions tests
   - Resolved chart interaction test problems
   - Fixed player detail view rendering tests
   - Corrected all dashboard interaction tests

## Development Priorities

1. **Stability**: Ensure all components function reliably under various conditions
2. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% passing tests as new features are added
3. **Performance**: Optimize for larger datasets without degrading user experience
4. **Feature Completion**: Add remaining planned features from roadmap
5. **Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and API references

## Key Decisions

1. **Testing Strategy**:
   - All tests follow standardized patterns for setup and teardown
   - E2E tests use a consistent helper for environment setup
   - Mock implementations closely simulate actual browser behavior
   - Test files organize tests by functional area rather than individual functions

2. **Error Handling**:
   - All components include proper error handling
   - Tests verify both success paths and error paths
   - Error messages are user-friendly while providing diagnostic information

## Communication Points

When discussing the project, emphasize:

1. **Testing Completeness**: 94 automated tests now pass across all testing levels
2. **Code Quality**: Standardized patterns for testing ensure consistent behavior
3. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling ensures robustness
4. **Maintainability**: Test helpers and utilities make adding new tests straightforward

## Next Steps

1. Add additional test coverage for edge cases
2. Implement test coverage reporting
3. Add performance testing for large datasets
4. Continue implementing additional features as outlined in the roadmap
5. Enhance test documentation with examples
