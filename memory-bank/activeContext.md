# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing the modular architecture to replace the large script.js file
- Starting the Chart Implementation phase with ApexCharts integration
- Improving code maintainability and organization
- Ensuring comprehensive test coverage

## Recent Changes
- Completed UI & Interaction phase with reactive table rendering:
  - Implemented UI-State connection for table components
  - Added state subscriptions for responsive UI updates
  - Updated table rendering to use state for sorting and filtering
  - Created comprehensive tests for UI reactivity
- Successfully implemented listeners module:
  - Created tableListeners.js for handling table interactions
  - Created a central listeners/index.js for managing all event handlers
  - Implemented proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Added comprehensive tests for event handling
- Updated main.js with complete initialization:
  - Implemented data loading and processing
  - Added UI component initialization with state connectivity
  - Set up event listeners and proper cleanup
  - Added comprehensive error handling
- Successfully implemented core modules:
  - Completed Phase 1 (Setup & Proof of Concept) with basic structure
  - Completed Phase 2 (Core Framework) with state management, DOM, and i18n
  - Completed Phase 3 (Data Handling) with data loading and processing
  - Completed Phase 4 (UI & Interaction) with reactive UI components
- Updated project documentation:
  - Revised implementation checklist to reflect current progress
  - Updated progress tracking in memory-bank
  - All tests are passing with excellent coverage

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of Phase 5: Chart Implementation
  - Create the charts.js module with ApexCharts
  - Implement chart configuration factories
  - Set up chart rendering functions
  - Connect charts to state management for reactivity
  - Add chart interaction handlers
- Develop tests for chart components and interactions
- Continue implementing the modular architecture per the implementation checklist

## Key Decisions
- Using ES6 module system for code organization
- Standardizing on ApexCharts for all chart rendering
- Supporting modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Serving ES6 modules directly without bundling
- Implementing a custom pub/sub state management pattern
- Creating a single entry point (main.js)
- Consolidating data processing into a single module with clean interfaces

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain consistent import paths across the application
- Focus on completing UI modules in a logical order
- Test interactive components thoroughly
- Maintain test coverage above 90% as we implement new modules
- Plan for eventual removal of script.js reference

## Timeline Expectations
- ✓ Phase 1 (Setup & Proof of Concept): Completed
- ✓ Phase 2 (Core Framework): Completed  
- ✓ Phase 3 (Data Handling): Completed
- ✓ Phase 4 (UI & Interaction): Completed
- ⏳ Phase 5 (Chart Implementation): In progress (2-3 days)
- Phase 6 (Integration & Testing): 3-4 days
- Estimated completion: 5-7 days
