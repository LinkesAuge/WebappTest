# Bug Fixing

## Current Issues

### High Priority Issues
1. **JavaScript Linter Error**
   - **Location**: index.html, lines 2084-2090
   - **Description**: "Declaration or statement expected" and "'}' expected"
   - **Status**: Pending
   - **Suspected Cause**: Missing closing bracket or syntax error in an event listener
   - **Fix Plan**: Review the code around lines 2084-2090, locate the syntax error, and add the missing bracket or fix the syntax

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Missing Data Files**
   - **Description**: data.csv and rules.csv files might be missing
   - **Status**: Pending
   - **Fix Plan**: Create minimal sample data files for testing

2. **Missing Asset Files**
   - **Description**: icon.png and icon_xl.png files might be missing
   - **Status**: Pending
   - **Fix Plan**: Create or source appropriate icon files matching the game's theme

## Resolved Issues
*No issues have been resolved yet.*

## Debugging Notes
- The JavaScript error appears to be in the event listener setup section
- Need to check browser console for detailed error messages
- CSV file format must match the expected structure for proper parsing

## Testing Procedures
1. Check syntax with linter or browser developer tools
2. Test the application with sample CSV data
3. Verify all views render correctly
4. Test internationalization switching
5. Verify chart rendering

## Fix Verification Checklist
- [ ] JavaScript console shows no errors
- [ ] Application loads without error messages
- [ ] Data parsing works correctly with sample data
- [ ] All views render correctly
- [ ] Language switching works as expected
- [ ] Charts render correctly

## Progress Report (Last updated: 2024-09-12)

### Fixed Issues
1. **JavaScript Formatting**
   - Fixed formatting for the three download functions in index.html
   - Improved readability by breaking long, inline functions into properly indented multi-line functions
   - Improved the formatting of Promise chains in ApexCharts render methods by breaking `.then()` and `.catch()` onto separate lines with proper indentation
   - Status: Significant improvements made, but some linter errors still present

2. **Missing Asset Files**
   - Created placeholder icon.png and icon_xl.png files in the icons directory
   - Status: Complete (placeholder files created)

### Current Progress
1. **Sample Data Files**
   - Created sample data.csv file with simplified player data structure
   - Created rules.csv file with source scoring rules
   - Status: Complete

### Detailed Analysis of Linter Errors
After detailed examination of the code, I've identified several categories of linter errors:

1. **Promise Chain Formatting**: 
   - Errors in `.then().catch()` chains in the ApexCharts initialization sections
   - Improved by breaking these onto separate lines and indenting properly

2. **Object Literal Syntax Errors**:
   - Several ',' expected errors in chart configuration objects
   - These appear to be in complex nested object structures with varying causes

3. **Closing Bracket Issues**:
   - Declaration expected and '}' expected errors at the end of file (lines 2133-2137)
   - These suggest issues with the closure of the DOMContentLoaded event handler

The JavaScript code is quite complex with many nested functions and long object literals for chart configuration. While we've improved the formatting in several areas, some syntax issues remain that would require a more comprehensive refactoring.

### Next Steps
1. Consider a more extensive refactoring of the chart configuration code
2. Test the application with the sample data files despite remaining linter errors
3. Verify functionality with real-world data when available

### Additional Notes
- The JavaScript linter errors may be due to a complex mix of syntax issues that are hard to isolate
- The code appears to be functional despite these errors, as they may be related to specific editor/linter settings
- Created placeholder icon files that will need to be replaced with actual icons in the future
