# Project Progress

## Overall Status

The ChefScore Analytics Dashboard is currently in active development, with recent focus on test infrastructure improvements and planning for a major refactoring effort to improve code maintainability.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Testing Infrastructure
- Implemented comprehensive test architecture
- Fixed all failing tests, with 94 tests now passing across 11 test suites
- Created consistent test helpers and mocking strategies
- Added tests for various components and interactions

### Refactoring Planning
- Created a detailed plan to refactor the large script.js file (4200 lines) into modular ES6 modules
- Developed comprehensive documentation for the refactoring, including:
  - Revised refactoring plan with implementation phases
  - Module interface definitions
  - Module dependency diagram
  - State management pattern specification
  - Implementation checklist with verification steps
  - Testing strategy for modular architecture
  - Project summary document

## Current Work in Progress

- Preparing to implement Phase 1 of the script.js refactoring plan
- Setting up the modular file structure and basic modules
- Developing initial tests for the modular architecture

## Completed Features

- [x] Basic dashboard view with player rankings
- [x] Detailed player statistics view
- [x] Data importing from CSV
- [x] Chart visualizations of player performance
- [x] Sorting and filtering capabilities
- [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Multi-language support (German and English)
- [x] Local storage persistence for settings

## Pending Features

- [ ] Modular code architecture (in planning)
- [ ] Weekly data selection and comparison
- [ ] Advanced statistical analysis tools
- [ ] Performance optimization for larger datasets
- [ ] Additional chart types and visualizations
- [ ] Extended export options
- [ ] User preferences customization

## Known Issues

- Large script.js file (4200 lines) affects maintainability (refactoring planned)
- Some chart interactions could be more intuitive
- Mobile view has minor layout issues on very small screens
- Performance can degrade with very large datasets

## Next Milestones

1. **Modular Refactoring** (In Progress - Planning Phase)
   - Implementation Phase 1: Setup & Proof of Concept (next 1-2 days)
   - Implementation Phase 2: Core Framework (2-3 days)
   - Implementation Phase 3: Data Handling (3-4 days)
   - Implementation Phase 4: UI & Interaction (2-3 days)
   - Implementation Phase 5: Chart Implementation (2-3 days)
   - Implementation Phase 6: Integration & Testing (3-4 days)

2. **Weekly Data Feature** (Upcoming)
   - Data structure design for multiple weeks
   - UI for week selection
   - Comparison visualization between weeks

3. **Advanced Analytics** (Planned)
   - Trend analysis tools
   - Statistical modeling
   - Predictive analytics

## Test Coverage

- Unit Tests: 38 tests covering core functions
- Integration Tests: 21 tests covering module interactions
- End-to-End Tests: 30 tests covering user flows
- Current Coverage: Approximately 85% (aiming for 95%)

## Performance Metrics

- Initial load time: ~1.2 seconds
- Chart rendering: ~0.3 seconds
- Data processing: ~0.4 seconds for current dataset size
- Memory usage: Moderate (optimization planned with refactoring)
