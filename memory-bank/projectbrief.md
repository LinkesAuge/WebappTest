# Project Brief: ChefScore Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
ChefScore is a web-based analytics dashboard designed to track and visualize player performance data for the mobile game Chef's Game. The application provides insights into player scores, chest collections, and various player statistics through interactive tables and charts.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Data Visualization
- Display player performance data in interactive, sortable tables
- Visualize player statistics through various chart types (bar, scatter, radar)
- Enable filtering and sorting of player data
- Support expanding charts to detailed views

### 2. Player Detail Views
- Show individual player performance metrics in a dedicated view
- Display player scores by category in a radar chart
- Provide breakdowns of player achievements

### 3. Cross-Section Analysis
- Enable analysis of performance by category
- Display rankings within each scoring category
- Visualize distribution of scores across players

### 4. Internationalization
- Support multiple languages (currently English and German)
- Allow easy switching between languages
- Maintain consistent translations across the application

### 5. Responsive Design
- Function across various device sizes and orientations
- Maintain usability on both desktop and mobile devices
- Adapt layout based on screen size

### 6. Performance
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Minimize loading times for data and visualizations
- Optimize chart rendering for smooth interactions

## Technical Goals

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- Maintain a clean, modular JavaScript structure
- Implement consistent error handling
- Follow best practices for web performance

### 2. Data Management
- Efficient loading and parsing of CSV data
- Intelligent caching to improve performance
- Structured data transformation for visualization

### 3. UI/UX Quality
- Create an intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface
- Implement consistent visual design
- Provide clear feedback for user actions

### 4. Testing
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Validate responsive design across devices

## Constraints

### 1. Technology
- Frontend-only implementation (no server-side processing)
- CSV as the primary data source format
- Modern browser support (no IE11 support required)

### 2. Performance
- Must handle datasets of up to 10,000 players
- Chart rendering must remain smooth and responsive
- Initial load time target under 3 seconds for typical datasets

## Success Criteria
- Users can easily navigate between different views
- Data visualizations provide clear insights
- All core functionality works across supported browsers
- Performance remains acceptable with large datasets
- Interface is intuitive and requires minimal explanation
