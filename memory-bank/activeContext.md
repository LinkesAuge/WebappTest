# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving the core functionality and stability of the ChefScore Analytics Dashboard. Recent efforts have addressed a critical bug in the player detail view where the radar chart was not rendering properly due to a missing `renderPlayerChart` function. This function has been implemented, allowing users to view detailed player performance data in the radar chart format.

### Recent Changes

1. **Python Test Infrastructure Implementation**
   - Created Python test runner scripts (run_tests.py, run_pytest.py, run_all_tests.py)
   - Added support for running both JavaScript and Python tests
   - Implemented automatic setup of Python test environments
   - Updated package.json with new test scripts
   - Added comprehensive documentation for test runners

2. **Test Infrastructure Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive test directory structure following the testing pyramid
   - Implemented unit tests for core data processing functions
   - Added integration tests for view transitions and UI components
   - Created end-to-end tests for key user flows
   - Set up test scripts and CI pipeline for automated testing

3. **Bug Fix: Player Detail Chart**
   - Implemented the missing `renderPlayerChart` function in script.js
   - Fixed radar chart rendering in the player detail view
   - Verified that player detail view now works correctly when accessed from the dashboard

4. **Documentation Setup**
   - Created Memory Bank files to document the project structure and requirements
   - Established system for tracking project progress and technical decisions
   - Added detailed testing documentation and test README

### Current Development Priorities

1. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Continue to add tests to reach 95% code coverage target
   - Implement additional edge case tests
   - Create more comprehensive UI interaction tests

2. **Stability Improvements**
   - Address any bugs identified through automated testing
   - Ensure consistent behavior across different browsers
   - Validate data processing with edge cases

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Improve loading times for large datasets
   - Optimize chart rendering performance
   - Implement more efficient data processing

4. **UI/UX Refinements**
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Improve error messaging for users
   - Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Data Processing Strategy

We are currently using a direct approach to data processing, where CSV data is loaded, parsed, and transformed in the main thread. For larger datasets, we're considering:

- Implementing pagination for large tables
- Adding virtual scrolling for improved performance
- Potentially using Web Workers for background data processing

### 2. Chart Rendering Approach

The current implementation uses Chart.js for all visualizations. We're evaluating:

- Further customization of chart options for better visual appeal
- Adding more interactive features to charts
- Implementing chart export functionality

### 3. Testing Strategy

We have established a comprehensive testing approach, including:

- Unit tests for core data processing functions
- Integration tests for UI components and view transitions
- End-to-end tests for key user flows
- Test coverage reporting with a target of 95% coverage
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing

Next steps for testing include:
- Adding more edge case tests
- Implementing performance tests
- Setting up cross-browser testing

### 4. Future Feature Consideration

Several feature enhancements are under consideration:

- Data filtering capabilities beyond simple search
- Comparison views for multiple players
- Time-series analysis if historical data becomes available
- Customizable dashboard layouts

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (1-2 Weeks)

1. Expand test coverage for remaining functions
2. Implement performance tests for large datasets
3. Run and fix any issues identified by the CI process
4. Implement basic performance optimizations

### Short-Term Goals (2-4 Weeks)

1. Enhance mobile responsiveness for better small-screen experience
2. Improve chart rendering performance
3. Add data filtering capabilities
4. Begin implementing unit tests for core functions

### Medium-Term Goals (1-2 Months)

1. Implement pagination or virtual scrolling for large datasets
2. Add comparison view for multiple players
3. Enhance chart interactivity
4. Add data export options for additional formats

## Communication and Collaboration

### Current Points of Discussion

1. Performance vs. feature richness tradeoffs
2. Browser compatibility priorities
3. Mobile-first vs. desktop-first approach to future development
4. Test coverage requirements

### Stakeholder Considerations

1. End users need intuitive access to performance data
2. Project maintainers need maintainable, well-documented code
3. Future developers need clear architecture and patterns
4. All stakeholders benefit from improved stability and performance
