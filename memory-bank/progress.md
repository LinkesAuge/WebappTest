# Project Progress

## Overall Status

The project is in a transition phase from "Chest Analyzer" to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard" with a focus on implementing a proper folder structure, creating testing infrastructure from scratch, and enhancing features.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Development Environment Improvements
- Set up Babel and ESLint configurations for better code quality
- Created package.json for dependency management with UV
- Removed all previous tests to start fresh with a proper testing approach

### User Interface Improvements
- Implemented responsive design for better mobile compatibility
- Added chart expansion feature for more detailed analysis
- Enhanced table sorting and filtering functionality
- Improved visual consistency across all views

### Data Visualization Enhancements
- Optimized chart rendering for better performance
- Added more interactive features to charts
- Improved chart tooltips and information display
- Enhanced color scheme consistency

## Current Work in Progress

- Planning folder structure reorganization
- Preparing to implement testing infrastructure from scratch
- Finalizing transition to "ChefScore Analytics Dashboard"
- Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes
- User experience optimization for mobile devices
- Performance improvements for large datasets

## Known Issues

- No testing infrastructure or tests currently available
- Large script.js file (4000+ lines) affects maintainability
- Flat project structure needs reorganization
- Some mobile view optimizations needed for very small screens
- Performance degradation with very large datasets
- Limited error handling for malformed CSV data

## Next Milestones

1. **Project Structure Reorganization**
   - Create app/ folder for application code
   - Move existing files to appropriate locations
   - Update references to maintain functionality

2. **Implement Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up testing environment from scratch
   - Create initial test structure
   - Develop first tests following TDD principles
   - Work toward >95% test coverage

3. **Finalize ChefScore Analytics Dashboard Transition**
   - Complete structural reorganization
   - Implement modular approach
   - Improve documentation

4. **Mobile Experience Enhancement**
   - Optimize table layouts for mobile
   - Improve touch interactions for charts
   - Enhance mobile navigation experience

## Performance Metrics

- Initial load time: ~1.5 seconds with typical dataset
- Chart rendering: ~0.3-0.5 seconds
- Data processing: ~0.5 seconds for current dataset size
- Mobile responsiveness: Good on most devices
- Current test coverage: 0% (no tests currently available)
