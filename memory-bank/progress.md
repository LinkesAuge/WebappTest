## Current Status

The Chest Analyzer application is currently in a stable state with all core functionality implemented and working. Recent work has focused on fixing critical UI issues, particularly with internationalization and chart rendering, resulting in a more reliable user experience.

The application successfully displays player data, generates insightful visualizations, and allows for detailed analysis across different time periods. Users can navigate between views, switch languages, and interact with various charts and data displays without encountering major issues.

### Next Focus Areas:
1. Comprehensive testing to ensure continued stability
2. Performance optimizations for larger datasets
3. User experience enhancements
4. Documentation completion

## Known Issues

1. Some performance degradation with very large datasets (1000+ players)
2. Minor styling inconsistencies in some mobile views
3. Potential edge cases in date formatting for specific locales
4. Chart rendering delays on lower-end devices
